# Shadowrun Dreams

This is intended to be a fairly complete character generator and manager for Shadowrun Sixth World. I plan
 to focus on functionality. Namely feature completeness and stability.

# Primary Planned Feature

* Complete support for creating new characters based on the core rulebook.
* Freely change between different stages of character creation.
* Support for GM overrides.
* Create empty characters and fill them out.
* "Living Character Sheet" mode for referencing during actual play.
* Roll20 macro export.
